# Rubiks Cube for Android

Super Old Implementation of Rubik's Cube for Android Platform with ability to change size of the cube: 2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 5x5x5.
Theoretically code base is made for universal sizing. But Android lags for the larger sizes.

The code base is from 2014. I have not refactored it yet. Probably in some future I will do it and make a documentation on what is going on there.

# Hot to build?
